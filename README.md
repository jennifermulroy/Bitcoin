Our project is to identify patterns in bitcoin trading data to determine what drives the price of Bitcoin. We will perform statistical analysis that will include daily volatility, trading volume, and cumulative returns to find relationships between the data and supply and demand factors. 
 
 Questions to Answer and Research: 
 - Is it a good long term investment or short investment? 
 - Can we apply traditional market statistic analysis on crytpo trading data? 
 - How will we determine which datasets will provide the most value to the analysis objective? 
 
 Datasets to explore:
 - Crypto exchange data
 - Equity market data 
 - Economic data 
 - Geographical data 
 - News sources 
 
 Rough Breadown of Tasks
